# SIAS_Global-Equity-Risk-Performance-Analysis

**Objective:**
This code enables the SIAS risk team to generate the latest risk metrics without accessing the Bloomberg terminal. All metrics provided serve as reference; to ensure they meet IPS requirements, please verify the most up-to-date figures against the data in the Bloomberg terminal.

All of the code can be run immediately by updating the file names to point to the latest SIAS portfolio asset-holding Excel file received from BNY Mellon, as well as the most recent benchmark holdings and weights downloaded from the iShares website (Benchmark: iShares MSCI ACWI ETFï¼›web link: https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239600/ishares-msci-acwi-etf).
